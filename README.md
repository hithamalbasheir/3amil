# 3amil (Android)

## Overview

**3amil** is the Android client of a full-stack application designed to help users find nearby gig workers, such as electricians, plumbers, and other service providers. This repository focuses on the Android implementation, using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern combined with Retrofit for network operations and RecyclerView for displaying lists of service providers.

## Features

- **Find Nearby Gig Workers**: Users can search and view profiles of skilled professionals in their area.
- **MVVM Architecture**: A clean separation of the user interface, business logic, and data handling to ensure a maintainable and scalable codebase.
- **Retrofit Integration**: Manages data fetching from the backend API efficiently.
- **RecyclerView**: Presents lists of gig workers in a user-friendly and performant way.
- **Data Binding**: Enhances code quality and readability by allowing declarative layouts.

## Project Structure

- **Model**: Represents the application's data structure and business logic.
- **View**: Consists of the UI elements that display data to the user.
- **ViewModel**: Connects the Model and View, handling all the data-related logic and preparing data for the UI.
- **Network**: Handles API calls using Retrofit to interact with the Django REST backend (hosted separately).

## Requirements

- Android Studio
- Gradle
- Java 8+

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hithamalbasheir/3amil.git
    ```
2. **Open the project** in Android Studio.
3. **Sync the Gradle files**.
4. **Configure the base URL** for the Retrofit client to point to your backend server.
5. **Run the application** on an Android device or emulator.

## Dependencies

- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview) - An advanced and flexible version of ListView.
- [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - A lifecycle-aware data holder.
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - A class that stores UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.

## Backend Integration

This Android client is designed to work with a Django REST framework backend, which handles user data, service listings, and interactions. The backend is not included in this repository. Please ensure you have the backend set up and running, and update the base URL in the Retrofit client accordingly.
